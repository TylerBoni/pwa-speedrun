# 7. Cursor (VS Code fork with AI agents)

## VSCode Fork - Familiar and extendable
- If using vscode, you can import your extensions and settings

## Repo
- Clone repo

## Built-in terminal
- control+` to open and close

## Prompts
- Auto agent can be used for virtually forever, other agents will limit your usage very quickly
- At times some agents will be listed as free, check often
- Start new chats often, and use @ to give agents context
- Can revert changes at any time
- Use git commits before making large changes to prevent breaking your application

## Working with our new project
- Clone repo from github
- Switch to dev branch if we want to avoid pushing to lovable
- ```pnpm i```
- ```pnpm run dev```
- Check that port is the same that we set up in supabase redirects
- We can start making all of the updates that were too expensive for lovable
